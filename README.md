# CheerNik_Engine
16.10.2020. Name is changed. I am starting to recreate everything in CheerNikEngine_1_3
18.10.2020. I tried to repeat a lot of Cherno code and here is much of the same... I need to review everything. I am working with events and window.
--The same day: 15:00. I did it! EvSys is capable to bind static functions to glfw window and process input events. This is quite simple system now.
--Also, I have PCH, auto DLL linking(just set DLL engine file in the EXE directory of game).
